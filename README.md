## How to Bold Text in HTML?
To bold the text in HTML, you can use either the `<strong>` tag or the `<b>` (bold) tag. Browsers will bold the text inside both of these tags the same way, but the `<strong>` tag indicates that the text is of particular importance. You can also bold text with the CSS `font-weight` property set to `bold`.

When bolding text, it’s considered a best practice to use the `<strong>` tag. This is because it is `semantic element`, whereas `<b>` is not. Non-semantic elements are worse for accessibility and can make content localization and future-proofing difficult. Additionally, if the text bolding is purely stylistic, it’s better to use CSS and keep all page styling separate from the content.
